note over agent,storage: These modules are located on cell tower board.

== Preparation steps ==

telco -> telco: Admin generates new key pair\n for cell company
telco -> telco: Admin generates new key pair\n for cell tower
telco -> substrate: Create new entity
telco -> substrate: Create new sub-entity
telco -> agent: Install software with\n cell tower private key

== Measurements steps ==

loop In some interval
  meas_module -> agent: Send measurement
  alt If measurement > threshold
    agent -> agent: Prepare transaction
    agent -> agent: Sign transaction
    agent -> substrate: Send signed\n transaction (store\n measurement spike)
  end
  agent -> storage: Store measurement
end

loop Every day
  agent -> storage: Get measurements for the last day
  storage --> agent: Return measurements
  agent -> agent: Accumulate measurements
  agent -> agent: Prepare transaction
  agent -> agent: Sign transaction
  agent -> substrate: Send transaction\n (store measurement)
end

== Certification steps ==

agent -> substrate: Store measurements

... In some time ...

alt Received required amount of measurements
note over substrate,agent
It means we receive
average measurements
for the whole month.
And it is enough data
to issue on-chain certificate.
end note
substrate -> substrate: Issue and store\n on-chain certificate
substrate -> substrate: Produce on-chain\n event about new\n certificate
else
  substrate ->x substrate: Stop current flow
end

... In some time ...

substrate -> telco: See new on-chain certificate\n on-chain event
telco -> substrate: Get on-chain certificate
substrate --> telco: Return on-chain\n certificate info
